# Emacs 27.1 Installation
This is for you as much as this is for me, since I want to remember some
stuff I do and the blog sometimes serves as a public knowledge base.

Regarding 27.1, there's plenty of great resources [here] and [here], so
I won't go over them.

Simple installation considering you have Development Tools and TLS
libraries installed for your distro:
```
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/emacs-27.1.tar.gz
./configure --with-json
make
make install
```

I'm only adding native JSON support since it's the number one (or
[number two] after language servers) feature in Emacs 27. Since the
loading order in 27 changes, I'm adding support for previous versions
with the following in my `.emacs.org ` file:
```
(when (< emacs-major-version 27)
  (package-initialize))
```

Additionally, I had to run `go get golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest ` in
order for gopls to not crash. Other than that, it seems like this
version hasn't broken any other elements of my set up; but it might
still be a little bit too early to tell!
